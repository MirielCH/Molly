# Molly Privacy Policy

This policy is effective as of 01 August 2023 and was last updated on 12 September 2023.  

## User information the bot collects

Molly does neither collect nor store any personal user data.  

## Command tracking

When you turn on the bot, it starts tracking some of your IDLE FARM commands. The term “tracking” refers to the name of these commands and the time when they were used.  
This information is used to calculate how many commands you used in `/stats`.  
You will get a warning that you enabled this when you use `/on`.  

Important things to note:  
• Tracking is only active if you manually activate Molly using `/on` first (opt-in).  
• You can opt-out at any time by turning off tracking in `/settings user`. Disabling this feature does not impact any of the other functions of the bot.  
• If you use `/off`, tracking - like everything else - will be disabled.  

## Message content access

Molly has access to the content of all messages it can see. This access is necessary to provide the service Molly does.  
Molly reads IDLE FARM messages and also reads the commands you issue to trigger said messages (e.g. if a claim message is detected, it will also read your `/claim` slash command or your `idle claim` message).  

The bot caches all messages sent by users that either mention the IDLE FARM bot or start with `idle `. They are used to reduce API calls and increase performance. These messages are discarded after 6 minutes and **not** stored permanently.  

## Account deletion

If you want to delete your data, you can use the command `/purge data` to do so.  
Please note that this will **permanently** delete all of your data in the bot, it is not possible to restore any of it.  

## Limits of this policy

Please be aware that I have no control over the code and policies of forks and other projects that use Molly's source code and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their respective privacy practices.  

This policy therefore only applies to:  
• The code in the [main repository](https://github.com/Miriel-py/Molly), maintained by myself.  
• The bot instance with the username `Molly#0020`, hosted by myself. If you encounter another Molly with another discriminator, it is outside of the scope of this privacy policy, even if it falsely links to this document.  

The bot may also link to external sites that are not operated by me. The same limits apply to those sites.  

## Changes to this policy

At my discretion, I may change my privacy policy to reflect updates. If I decide to change this privacy policy, I will post the changes here at the same link by which you are accessing this privacy policy.  

## Contact me

For any questions or concerns regarding this policy, you may contact me (Miriel#0001) in the [Molly support server](STILL NOT YET).
